A react project youtube-like clone currently in sprint-1 of development. Utilizing useState, components, and props to create a basic ui that updates the current video along with it's details and comments, and populates a list of "next videos" from a json file.

Future sprints will update from static content to dynamic content through an API, and add functionality around uploading new videos, adding comments, and searching for videos.
